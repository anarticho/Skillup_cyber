1. Working on Kali Linux machine through ./home/anarticho/BUFFER_OVERFLOW:
	1. [Overflow Exploit](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6sUd3AA7Q50)
	2. [Notes](./NOTES/buffer_overflow_workshits.md)
	3. C program (main.C) that have buffer overflow vulnerability.
	4. Pending to finish...
2. It was necessary to dig into x86-64 assembly:
    1. [Gedare Bloom - x86-64 assembly](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lUbPUWtmVUU&t=491s)
	2. [Notes](./NOTES/x86-64_first_raw.md) -> __to be moved on blog's post__
3. Not understanding well the assembly code, going to do some basics things:
	1. [Reading assembly](https://wolchok.org/posts/how-to-read-assembly-language/) mentions that RBP register is no longer used on modern architectures. Instead, the stack is growing for local variables, and the at reaching the ret instruction, it pop all elements from stack and retrieve the return address to jump on.
	2.[Cracking x86-64](https://medium.com/@sruthk/cracking-assembly-calling-conventions-in-x86-cc035d66f3f3)
	3. simple_main.c the program to study x86-64 calling convention.
