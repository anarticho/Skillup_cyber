## Organization
- Review follow ups.
- Having a backup for WSL2 (C:\...\Desktop\Backup Kali)
- Remove github repository from kali

## Day flow
- Figuring out that python3 provide Unicode Text String output, when python2 was Byte String.
    (https://discuss.python.org/t/unusal-behavior-of-python3-print-hex-values/15418/8)
- Let's create a C++ program to generate byte-text string to be used as "python -c 'print(..)'" into gdb run $() 
    > VS_work/binary_stdout
        > C++ with main entry point + Translater class.
        > Make file.

## Tomorrow
- Twitch live stream?
- Debug program using GDB.
- Idea to have an executable (as tgdb):
    - to open a shell,
    - to provide tty to binary_stdout to write on,
    - ou un DDL main.
