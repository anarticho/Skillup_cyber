1. Kali linux on WSL stable !
2. Wasted time on interface (with Splitmind).
3. Tools that are used here:
	- GCC (appending symbols usign the -g flag "gcc -g -o exe_file c_file.c)
	- PWNDBG as GDB pluggin (https://github.com/pwndbg/pwndbg)

	Then for the interface it's a mix of:
	- GDB-dashboard (https://github.com/cyrus-and/gdb-dashboard)
	- TMUX for Terminal Multiplexer (https://github.com/tmux/tmux).

	TMUX usage can be avoided by displaying each module of GDB-dashboard in a separate terminal (https://gitee.com/dongbo_89/gdb-dashboard#display-each-module-in-a-separate-terminal).
4. We are going to use:
	- GDB
	- GDB-dashboard (https://gitee.com/dongbo_89/gdb-dashboard#installation + https://github.com/cyrus-and/gdb-dashboard)
	- TMUX (https://github.com/tmux/tmux + https://hamvocke.com/blog/a-quick-and-easy-guide-to-tmux/)
	- PWNDBG (https://github.com/pwndbg/pwndbg)

5. Using implementation from https://github.com/ficoos/tgdbdb/tree/master.
